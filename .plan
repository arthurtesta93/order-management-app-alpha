Preamble: this file will contain development notes regarding building this application. 
It should help understanding my learning process and justifying design decisions, as
well as recognizing mistakes. It is a mortal's homage to J. Carmack's legendary .plan 
files from the 90s. 
In english for practice and /reach/

+**Created component to get organization data**
    - this is a workaround based on flawed model design for Facilities, as they should contain the organization name by design
    - *API refactor reason {1}* 

I already have items, organizations and facilities. I am scratching the warehouses/docks models for now, just want to get the POC
working with plenty of unit tests before expanding.

Also may rewrite the API entirely for the reasons i am listing.

*The API tree structure is currently not great. I think it could be better structured or just simplified (E.g. get rid of /core/).*
*One example of this is that i will need to create context variables to be used in dataProvider, which will change depending on the resource used (!)*

TODO
refactor [dataProvider] to dynamically route the API according to the resource;
shipping orders
purchase orders
item instances
